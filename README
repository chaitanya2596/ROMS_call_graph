Call Graph Generator
This project generates a call graph from Fortran source files and outputs it in text format. 
Users have the option to include nf90 functions by enabling the --include-nf90 flag in the Makefile.


Prerequisites
    g++ (GCC) with C++17 support
    Python 3

Building and executing the Project
    Before building the project, ensure the following configurations in the Makefile:
        1. Set the DIR variable to the path of the Build_roms directory.
        2. Specify the desired value for INCLUDE_NF90 to include or exclude nf90 functions.
        3. StartFunction can be mentioned to get call graph from that particular function.

To build the project, run the following command in the root directory: 
    
    make 

Cleaning Up
################       Always make sure to clean up the build       ################
################  artifacts before running the make command again.  ################

To clean up the build artifacts, run:
    
    make clean

This will remove the build_graph directory and its contents.
